# computervision-gym
 basic computer vision in python for analysing gym squat form.
 Opencv used for general image things and mediapipe specifically for pose recognition.
 Use esc to stop the program.

Features:
- Relevant "joints" go green when the model is confident it is correct (editable constant)
- Display of leg joint confidence
- Editable constant for required height difference to detect a rep
- Display of angle behind leg
- Display of FPS (indicator of performance)
- Rep counter (with overcounting prevention)

This could be extended to other exercises/movements in future without too much additional development.
